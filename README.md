# Hangman-Project


## Description
Project designed to implement the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
The aim of the project is to pull in altogether all that I have learnt so far throughout my course with AiCore. 

Learnings so far: 
- How all different data types work
- How to implement the random variable
- Using while, if and for loops within a class
- Initialising self within the class
