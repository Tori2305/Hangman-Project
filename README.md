# Hangman-Project
The classic game of hangman - the computer generates a random word and you have 5 guesses to guess what that word is.

##**Description**
The aim of the project is to test the skills learned so far throughout my AiCore training course. Including; all data types, while,for and if loops, error handling and object orientation programming to name but a few. 

##**Learnings**
- The use of self. within the class and how to call on this when you're outside that class.
- Formatting clearly so that code is easily followed and edited if necessary.
- Learned how to handle errors and implement changes to fix.
- Sanity print statement checks ;)

##Installation instructions

##**Usage instructions**
Play as it is or if you'd like to change parts of the game, you can amend the following:

- Change the words for the computer to choose from, see list in line 2, be sure to rename the variable if fruit is no longer relevant. (You will also need to change this on *line 56* when you call the function play_game.
