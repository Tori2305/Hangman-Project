# Hangman-Project
The classic game of hangman - the computer generates a random word and you have 5 guesses to guess what that word is.

## Description
The aim of the project is to test the skills learned so far throughout my AiCore training course. Including; all data types, while,for and if loops, error handling and object orientation programming to name but a few. 

Learnings:
- The use of self. within the class and how to call on this when you're outside that class.
- Formatting clearly so that code is easily followed and edited if necessary.
- Learned how to handle errors and implement changes to fix.
- Sanity print statement checks ;)
